## Explination
- Github pages allows the user to static host files and serve them at the address {username}.github.io by naming a repository like that and enabling it in the settings
- E.g. my username is @Oddert so my repository named oddert.github.io is a static site
- This repo demonstrates that other static repositories can be added as an extention to that domain.
- In this case going to [oddert.github.io/pages-test](https://oddert.github.io/pages-test/) will display this index.html
